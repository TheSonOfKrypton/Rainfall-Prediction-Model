# Rainfall Prediction Model

This project predicts rainfall in Sydney using machine learning algorithms and real-world weather data. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model selection (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression), hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation with practical commentary.

**Note:** Viewing the notebook's HTML on GitHub may be hard to read due to the test outputs. For best experience, download and run the notebook locally in Jupyter or Colab.
