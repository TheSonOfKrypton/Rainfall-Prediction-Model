        "# Rainfall Prediction with Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "I did this rainfall prediction project as part of the IBM Machine Learning with Python course on Coursera; I was curious about how machine learning could be applied to something as unpredictable as weather.\n",
        "\n",
        "What really excited me about this project was the chance to work with actual meteorological data rather than clean, academic datasets. I wanted to understand what it's really like to build a classifier from the ground up and see how different algorithms perform on the same problem. Plus, who hasn't wondered if they could predict whether to bring an umbrella tomorrow?\n",

        "* Explore and perform feature engineering on a real-world dataset to understand how raw data becomes model-ready\n",
        "* Build a classifier pipeline and optimize it using grid search cross validation\n",
        "* Evaluate my model by interpreting various performance metrics and visualizations to really understand what the numbers mean\n",
        "* Implement different classifiers by updating my pipeline to see how various algorithms compare\n",
        "* Use appropriate parameter sets for grid search optimization in each case\n",

        "In this project, we explored the use of machine learning to predict rainfall in Sydney with real-world weather data. The process involved thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and treatment of missing values to ensure reliable model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost delivered the highest accuracy, handling the dataset’s complexity and the natural class imbalance well. Logistic Regression worked as an interpretable baseline, but was less effective for predicting rainy days compared to the more sophisticated models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuning model parameters via grid search helped further optimize performance. For future work, improvements like additional feature selection, or more ensemble approaches could enhance the model’s ability to predict rain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, these results demonstrate strong predictive potential and a solid starting point for operational rainfall forecasting!"
